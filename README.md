# BattleShip
This project is the generic Battleship game we all know and have played. We have 3 separate ways to play the game in this project. 
We have the classic 1v1 battleship game that players can play locally on the same computer. We also have networking in this game, meaning that if 2 players
are on the same local network they can play this game on 2 separate computers. Lastly, if you don't have another person to play with, we also have a player vs.
computer mode that you can play anytime.
